Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to score more points than the dealer,
but not more than 21. At the beginning of the game,
the dealer deals two cards to the player and then to himself.
The dealer sees all the player's cards when the player sees only the dealer's first card.
After dealing the cards, the player is asked to take a card.
If he refuses, the dealer takes the cards.
Each card rank has its own equivalent in points:
- Ace is 11 or 1
- The number in the rank equals to the number of points (2 is 2, 6 is 6 etc)
- Jack is 10
- Queen is 10
- King is 10

If a player has a blackjack (2 cards with a total of 21 points),
he can take a 1:1 win or wait for the dealer to reveal his cards.
If the dealer also has a blackjack, the player's bet is refunded.
But f the dealer has not a blackjack, the player take a 3:2 win.
If the player has more points than the dealer and no more than 21 (not blackjack),
he take a 1:1 win. In other situations, the player loses and his bet is lost.
